# Quick Start
    
PWABuilder is an open source tool that allows developers to package their PWAs for publishing to various stores, including Microsoft, Google Play, Meta Quest, and the iOS App Store. 

## Prerequisites

If your web app meets a few baseline PWA requirements, you can use PWABuilder to validate, score, and package your application for stores.

Your PWA needs to:

* be published at a public URL
* have a complete web manifest
* be secured with HTTPS

If your app meets these requirements, you can package with PWABuilder.

?> **Note** To publish your package, you will need a Developer Account with each platform you want to publish with. 
For the Microsoft and Google Play stores, these cost a one time fee of $19 and $25, respectively. For the Apple App Store, 
an account costs a recurring $99 per year.

## Packaging
You can have an application package for your PWA in just a few steps:

1. From the  [homepage of PWABuilder](https://www.pwabuilder.com/), you can enter a URL to start the packaging process.
