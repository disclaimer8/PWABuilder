# PWABuilder Studio Quick Start

PWABuilder Studio is an extension for Visual Studio Code that provides tooling for working with and creating progressive web apps. 

You can use PWABuilder Studio to: 

* Create a new PWA using the [starter template](https://github.com/pwa-builder/pwa-starter)
* Convert an existing web app into a PWA
* Manage your app's manifest, service workers, and icons
* Package your apps for the Microsoft, Google, and Apple Stores
* Validate your PWA across several metrics
* Add web capabilities with code snippets

If you're new to developing PWAs and aren't sure where to start, check out this [blog series.](https://microsoft.github.io/win-student-devs/#/)

## Getting the Extension
The PWABuilder Code extension is available within Visual Studio Code in the extensions tab. If you search for `PWABuilder Studio` or `PWABuilder`, it should be the first result. 
Click the `Install` button to add the extension to Visual Studio Code.

If you don't have Code and want to try out the extension, you can install it [here.](https://code.visualstudio.com/)

## Using Commands
You can access all of PWABuilder Studios actions by hitting `Ctrl-Shift-P` within Visual Studio Code to open a dialogue to choose a command. Type in PWA to filter for results from the extensions:

</div>

Selecting any of the commands from this menu will launch the associated PWABuilder Studio command, and may prompt you for further input. You can learn more about how to use these commands in the other sections of the documentation.

## Navigating the GUI

If you're tired of VS Code shortcuts, PWABuilder Studio also has an interface for interaction with the extension. You can find the interface by selecting the PWABuilder Studio tab in your Code Window:

</div>


After selecting the PWABuilder Studio tab, the leftmost pane of your Code window will now show a pane containing the interface for using the extension. Additionally, you'll also be able to access many of the commands from the extension on the bottommost bar of VS Code:

You can learn how to use the different functions of the GUI in the various sections of the documentation.
