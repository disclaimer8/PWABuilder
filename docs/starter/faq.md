# Frequently Asked Questions

Welcome to the PWA Starter FAQ!

If you have a question that isn't addressed here or elsewhere in the documentation, feel free to open an [issue.](https://github.com/pwa-builder/PWABuilder/issues/new/choose)

#### Do I have to use the PWA Starter to build progressive web apps?
No! Just about any normal web stack can be adapted to a progressive web app. The PWA Starter is just a lightweight and easy to use starting point for those looking to build a great PWA.

#### Why does the PWA Starter use web components?
The PWA Starter uses web components because they are fast, standardized, and maintainable. They work within any framework and lend themselves to quality, modular code. Check out this [*Why Web Components*](https://www.fast.design/docs/resources/why-web-components) article for more info.

#### Why should I build a progressive web app?
PWAs bring the best of the native and web worlds together. Through web capabilities, PWAs allow web-based applications to integrate deeply with different platforms, much like a native-built application typically would. 

They are cross-platform by nature and discoverable through both the browser and through app stores. You can count on your PWA to be useable everywhere and to reach as wide an audience as possible through a single codebase.

#### I'm brand new to PWAs and not ready to develop yet, where should I start?
Check out this [article series](https://microsoft.github.io/win-student-devs/#/) for learning all about progressive web apps. It will take you from learning the very basics, all the way to some best practices for development.
