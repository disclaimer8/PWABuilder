# Technologies Used

The PWA Starter uses only a handful of libraries in order to remain lightweight and performant, but also while remaining easy and efficient to develop on. 


#### Lit
Lit is the library that we use to build our custom web components for the Starter. Lit adds some simple boilerplate that makes it easy to build standardized web components. 
If you're new to web components, check out this [resource.](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Web_Components)

All of our pages are components themselves, and are built using Lit. 

Learn more about Lit [here.](https://lit.dev/)

#### Shoelace
In addition to custom components built with Lit, the Starter also makes use of prebuilt UI components.

The starter uses [Shoelace](https://shoelace.style/) for its user interface.

#### Vite
The Starter uses Vite as part of its build process. 

Vite handles our code bundling and development server, and exposes PWA-specific functionality through the VitePWA plugin.

#### Vaadin Router
For routing, the Starter uses Vaadin Router, a lightweight client-side router that works easily with web components.

#### Azure Static Web Apps CLI
The Starter uses the Azure Static Web Apps CLI to enable you to deploy your PWA to Azure, along with local performance testing etc.
